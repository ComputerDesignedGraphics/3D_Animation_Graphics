This concept is to have a seed drill make a hole, plant a seed, water it - pots will rotate around the base/and or even have the arm rotate - so much to choose from.  Sooooooo many ideas brewing.

Lots of ideas, changes, need to make it more "cartoon" by finishing the eyes and yet I've steered into a "no no" zone with Organic mixed with Metal/Chrome/Plastic and find there is a fine line between this and that.

I used Substance Painter, Exported FBX, imported, and FINALLY have a working product.  Inside Substance one can get carried away - just 10 hours or so of work and 10 mins of product output - but learning is just that, time, patience, and practice.

I also used Maya and UV mapped, unwrapped, and was going to add a custom logo however - I know it will completely remove the Substance Painter colors/etc - there has to be something/someway or if not - I will have to figure out some course of action to import things (like a logo) right in and use it (I have a gamming inc logo)

More or less I find thinking takes more time than doing, then when it come to textures thinking "what works" has taken things to a new level of insanity (good insanity)

Going overboard?? Absolutely in so many ways however, I wanted to learn how to put liquid into a glass pipe, I wanted to finally get substance working perfectly (and I did) and I also CAN'T STAND how stupid Sketchfab is, I am, with it - it appeared upside down, white, yet there is all my stuff and no matter what I clicked on :( still stupid grey.

More fun some other day.
