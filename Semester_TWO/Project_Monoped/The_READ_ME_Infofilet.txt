zBrushing new work on Kaa from 1967 Jungle Book.  Strange things happened when I imported the Flower into zBrush, it didn't handle it well at all.  Photoshoped an image now adding it for reference in zBrush

I created Kaa and finally got zBrush methods working (over 6 hours of videos, training, learning, doing)

Kaa turned out amazing - then I watched your video and did the export necessary

Importing into Maya turned out AMAZING

I began to Retopo and do edge loops - then realized I need to STOP, take a second and THINK, and realized the model needed to actually close it's mouth.

I began working on re-sculpting a mouth that actuall close (as close as possible) and started Retopo and Quad Drawing again.

Finished product so incredible no need to port back to zBrush it's on to Painter

Inside the video of your shark I watched and learned how to added masks and so many layers to build up a neat deisgn - this is NEW info, new to practice and I ran out of time/steam and will finish work on it asap.

Final product will be ready very soon and I will add nifty video into the Submission part very very soon.
